# LoRaWithNeo7MandMore
In this repository is about Arduino project with LoRa SX1278 And E25 LoRa And GPS for making things/

Requirement for Using this respiratory

-An Arduino Mega And Arduino UNO R3

-NEO 7M GPS

-LoRa SX1278 SPI And Ebyte E19 SPI

(recommended) external Power supply to the Bread Board of Transimitor because GPS consume a lot of power


Installation

Arduino Mega

-RX AND TX TO GPS RX 19 TX 18

-53 To NSS of SX1278,RST to pin 9 ,DIO to 22 and Other regrad of SPI of arduino mega
recommended use gps near door or outside since it need to lock with strong signal.


Arduino R3

Follow Arduino R3 SPI pin.
